# The Road Not Taken

Author: Brad Zhang

Design: Intended to be a 2D choice game, with many forks in the road. Some choices would give the player a minigame to complete.

Text Drawing: Text drawing is computed at runtime. Each piece of text is run through harfbuzz, which shapes the text with Times New Roman font. FreeType is used to load the font. OpenGL drawing of font is not implemented (did not have time)
